If you have a more advance threat, then you can double down with flashing your ROM that your BIOS device and use coreboot, libreboot, osboot. This makes it much more difficult for someone to manipulate your device, and break into it, but you should always encrypt your drives to prevent people from copying your stuff, and to see all your activities, but know the risk that someone can wipe away your data, but its better for it to be wiped, than for it to be read by someone without your consent.
