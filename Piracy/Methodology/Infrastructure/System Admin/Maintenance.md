You have to have a up time and downtime of maintenance, this is not for professional use, but its better to learn how to do it like a professional, if you'd like to take this to the next level for other homlabing purposes, then its good to keep in mind on how to fix things, and refurbish device, and learning to troubleshoot your devices. You must also make sure you clean the dust, and add thermal paste to the cpu every 2 years minimum (depends on how often your computer is left on for).
