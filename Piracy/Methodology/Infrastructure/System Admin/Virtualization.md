only connect the device to the internet if needed. Most software does not need to connect to the internet for it to work, and if it does then don't use it because it'll connect to a server to verify its authenticity, and can possibly hardware/IP ban whatever you used for future use of the software. It can also jump from one device to another if your firewall is not implemented correctly because of a change you did recent and you didn't realize that you left a gap open, so limiting that chance is crucial for your device safety/data.
